# Thunder-Meteorite
The meteorite selling tool, and the other will be a meteorite buying tool. These programs are to be built in an object oriented manner. These will have a tool that shows the map of the world, which will be marked with the location of where the meteorite was found. Also, the system shall list out current meteorites for sale. 

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to cover the introductory material of the Java language, including
- Use of basic data types,
- Controls,
- Simple concrete classes,
- Files,
- Exception handling.
- Simple collection types

# Problem:
Create two programs, one will be a meteorite selling tool, and the other will be a meteorite buying tool. These programs are to be built in an object oriented manner. These will have a tool that shows the map of the world, which will be marked with the location of where the meteorite was found. Also, the system shall list out current meteorites for sale. In addition, two UML class diagrams, one for each program, will be submitted for grading.
  
# The Diagrams and Output.
Create a class diagram of each program, showing the aggregation and association between the classes. There should be no inheritance links in this phase of the project. There should be two diagrams: One for Meteorite Seller Tool, and one for Meteorite Buyer Tool. Turn in a printout of the finished map to Blackboard. The map must be populated with a minimum of 12 meteorites.
